# DES

An implementation of DES in Java made by the CouncilOfMortys team

## Usage

TerminalDES will ask the user for a plain/cipher text file and a key. These files must be encoded in UTF-8 and use character in the ASCII subset. It will then prompt the user if they wish
for the input file to be encrypted or decrypted. The user must respond with encrypt or decrypt.
